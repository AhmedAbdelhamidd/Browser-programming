# Lecture 03 – CSS Basics

## What I implemented this lecture
- Linked an external CSS file to the HTML document.
- Applied basic styles like background color, text color, and font family.
- Organized the project structure into folders (CSS and HTML).

## CSS selectors I used
1. **Element Selector**: Used `body` to set the background and font.
2. **Element Selector**: Used `h1` to style the main heading.
3. **External Link**: Used the `<link>` tag to connect the stylesheet.

## One thing I struggled with
- Managing file paths and ensuring the CSS file is correctly linked when using folders.

## One improvement I want to do next
- Learn how to use more complex selectors like Class and ID selectors for better control.
