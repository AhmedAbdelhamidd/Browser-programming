# Lecture 03 – CSS Basics

## What I implemented this lecture
- Created external CSS file and linked it to HTML
- Applied typography styling with readable fonts and proper line heights
- Implemented spacing using both margin and padding throughout the page
- Styled header and footer with background colors and padding
- Transformed navigation from a plain list to a horizontal menu
- Made all images responsive with max-width: 100% and height: auto
- Applied layout constraints with max-width and centered content using margin: 0 auto
- Added hover effects and smooth transitions for better user experience

## CSS selectors I used (at least 5)
- **Element Selector**: `body`, `h1`, `h2`, `p`, `header`, `footer`, `nav`, `img`
- **Descendant Selector**: `nav ul`, `nav li`, `nav a`, `main section`, `#portfolio figure`
- **Group Selector**: Applied consistent styling to multiple elements
- **Class Selector**: `.skip-link` for accessibility
- **ID Selector**: `#portfolio` for specific section styling
- **Pseudo-class Selector**: `a:hover`, `nav a:hover`, `.skip-link:focus`

## One thing I struggled with
- Balancing the spacing between sections to ensure the page looks clean and organized without too much whitespace. I had to experiment with different margin and padding values to find the right balance.

## One improvement I want to do next
- Add a CSS Grid or Flexbox layout for the portfolio items to make them display in a responsive grid instead of stacking vertically. This would make better use of screen space on larger displays.
